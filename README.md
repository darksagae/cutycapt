### Examples and Output

1.  **Basic Screenshot**

    To capture a basic screenshot of a website and save it as a PNG image:

    ```bash
    cutycapt --url=http://example.com --out=example.png
    ```

    This command captures the webpage at `http://example.com` and saves it as `example.png` in the current directory. There is no terminal output, but the file `example.png` will be created.
2.  **Screenshot with Delay**

    To capture a screenshot of a website that requires a few seconds to load all elements:

    ```bash
    cutycapt --url=http://example.com --out=example_delayed.png --delay=2000
    ```

    This command adds a 2-second delay (2000 milliseconds) before capturing the screenshot.  There is no terminal output, but the file `example_delayed.png` will be created.
3.  **Setting Minimum Dimensions**

    To ensure the captured image has a minimum width and height:

    ```bash
    cutycapt --url=http://example.com --out=example_min_size.png --min-width=800 --min-height=600
    ```

    This command sets the minimum width to 800 pixels and the minimum height to 600 pixels. There is no terminal output, but the file `example_min_size.png` will be created.
4.  **Using HTTP Authentication**

    To capture a screenshot of a website that requires HTTP authentication:

    ```bash
    cutycapt --url=http://example.com/protected --out=protected.png --http-auth-user=myuser --http-auth-pwd=mypassword
    ```

    This command provides the username `myuser` and password `mypassword` for HTTP authentication. There is no terminal output, but the file `protected.png` will be created.
5.  **Disabling JavaScript**

    To capture a screenshot with JavaScript disabled:

    ```bash
    cutycapt --url=http://example.com --out=example_nojs.png --javascript=off
    ```

    This command disables JavaScript before capturing the screenshot. There is no terminal output, but the file `example_nojs.png` will be created.

### Notes

*   CutyCapt does not display any output to the terminal during normal operation. The success of the command is indicated by the creation of the output file.
*   Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to write to the output directory.
*   The quality of the screenshot can be affected by the rendering engine. Experiment with different options to achieve the desired result.
